Howdy, everyone! Rei here! I am very excited to announce the development of the dedicated guides and documentation site for Unity Party! This site will become to go-to place for anything you need help with in Unity Party. From the basic to the advanced, you will find answers here.

At the moment, the website is still under construction while we still write detailed information for both the guide and documentation.

*But are those the same?* **Nope!** We plan to have the guides be written tutorials and the documentation go into further details about stuff, such as modscripting and internal scripts.

We hope that this website, when finished, will help you all on using Unity Party to its fullest!
